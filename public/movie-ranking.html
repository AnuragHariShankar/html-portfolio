<h1>The Best Movies According to Anurag </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Paddington</h3>
<p>The bear was really realistic and he was very funny.</p>

<h3>Ron's gone wrong</h3>
<p>Barney's emotion and attachment to his b-bot was very engaging</p>

<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>The point when Tony Stark died was a suspence for me.</p>
